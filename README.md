Chess Knight's Path Optimizer
=============================
### Intro
A software that renders you the optimized path for a Chess Knight to move from bottom left of a chess board in size of n to the top right size of it written in Arendelle with an UNIX launcher written in C based on [Pouya Kary's Chess Knight Path Optimization Algorithm](http://kary.us/projects/knight/)
