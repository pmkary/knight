Chess Knight's Path Optimizer
=============================
### Intro
A software that renders you the optimized path for a Chess Knight to move from bottom left of a chess board in size of n to the top right size of it written in Arendelle with an UNIX launcher written in C based on [Pouya Kary's Chess Knight Path Optimization Algorithm](http://kary.us/chessknight)
### Setup
To run the software:
* Download and Install [Arcade IDE](http://developer.arendelle.org/technologies/arcade)
* Download the repo and put files where you like.
* If you're using UNIX you can open the knight.c and then change the command to your file then compile it using gcc -o knight ./knight.c and then move the knight to /usr/bin
